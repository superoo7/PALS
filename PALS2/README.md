[Calculation](/PALS2_Solution.pdf)

### Question 1
Given the data

| x    	| 1    	| 2 	| 3    	| 5     	|
|------	|------	|---	|------	|-------	|
| f(x) 	| 4.75 	| 4 	| 5.25 	| 19.75 	|


Calculate f(4) using 

(i)	Newtonâ€™s Interpolating Polynomials of order 1 & 2. 

(ii)	Lagrange Polynomials of the 1st and 2nd order

### Question 2
The following data defines the sea-level concentration of dissolved oxygen for fresh water as a function of temperature:

| T, C    	| 0      	| 8      	| 16    	| 24    	| 32    	| 40    	|
|---------	|--------	|--------	|-------	|-------	|-------	|-------	|
| o, mg/L 	| 14.621 	| 11.843 	| 9.870 	| 8.418 	| 7.305 	| 6.413 	|

Use MATLAB to find the sea-level concentration of dissolved oxygen for fresh water at the temperature of 27oC using

(i)	Linear splines

(ii)	Quadratic splines

(Note: The exact result is 7.986 mg/L)
